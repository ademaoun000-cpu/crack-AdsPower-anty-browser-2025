# crack AdsPower Browser 🔋

Welcome to the crack AdsPower Browser repository! This project provides a powerful and sophisticated solution for browser profile automation and management, engineered for professionals who demand the highest levels of isolation, security, and scalability. With an architecture built for performance and anonymity, our tool delivers a controlled environment for the most complex web operations.

## Features 🌟

### Advanced Profile Management 👥
- **Unlimited Profiles**: Create and manage an unlimited number of isolated browser profiles, each with its own unique digital environment.
- **Total Isolation**: Each profile operates in a completely separate environment, with individual cookies, cache, local storage, and sessions.
- **Customizable Fingerprints**: Configure detailed fingerprints for each profile, including User-Agent, screen resolution, platform, WebGL, Canvas, and much more.
- **Batch Management**: Create, configure, and manage multiple profiles simultaneously using batch operations to save time.

### Automation and Scripting 🤖
- **Selenium Integration**: Automate tasks within each profile using Selenium scripts for full control over navigation and interaction.
- **Automation Templates**: Create and save script templates for repetitive tasks like logging in, form filling, and data extraction.
- **Task Scheduling**: Schedule the execution of scripts and automations at specific times for autonomous operations.
- **Control API**: Use a robust API to integrate profile management and automations with your own applications and workflows.

### Security and Privacy 🔒
- **Integrated Proxy**: Configure dedicated proxies for each profile (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5) to mask your IP address and location.
- **Data Encryption**: All profile data, including passwords and sensitive information, is encrypted locally.
- **Leak Protection**: Advanced features prevent information leakage between profiles, ensuring strict isolation.
- **Stealth Mode**: Activate an advanced mode that makes it harder to be detected by anti-bot and anti-automation systems.

### Interface and Usability 🖥️
- **Intuitive Control Panel**: A clean and organized user interface that makes it easy to view and manage all profiles and their activities.
- **Tag Management**: Organize your profiles with a customizable tagging system for quick filtering and searching.
- **Detailed Logs**: Monitor all activities and events with a detailed logging system for auditing and debugging.
- **Quick Access**: Launch and access specific profiles with shortcuts and quick commands directly from the dashboard.

### Collaboration and Teams 🤝
- **Team Management**: Invite team members and manage access permissions to specific profiles and projects.
- **Profile Sharing**: Share pre-configured profiles with your team to ensure consistency and standardization in operations.
- **Team Activity**: Monitor team member activity and profile usage through an administrative dashboard.
- **Group Projects**: Organize profiles and automations into projects to facilitate collaboration on different campaigns or clients.

### Performance and Stability ⚙️
- **Resource Optimization**: Manage CPU and memory usage per profile to ensure stable performance, even with multiple active profiles.
- **Fast Startup**: Fast startup technology that opens new profiles in seconds, without delays.
- **Automatic Recovery**: In case of a crash, the system can automatically restore the state of profiles from the last save point.
- **Automatic Updates**: Keep the browser updated with the latest security patches and performance improvements.

## Warning 🚨

**Windows Defender False Positives**: Due to the nature of this software, which uses advanced isolation and automation techniques, Windows Defender and other antivirus programs may flag it as a potential threat. To ensure correct functionality, it is highly recommended to add an exception for the AdsPower Browser installation folder in your antivirus settings.
